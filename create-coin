NEWTUM : Create your own crypto-currency 

1.) Planning your coin 
Name of Coin =  kriscoin
Symbol of coin = KRIS 
Public Address = K
Max Coins = 1000 millions
Mining Rewards = 100
Halving Interval = 2 years
Block Interval = 1 min
Pre-Mined Coins = 1%
Algorithm = Scrypt Algorithm (Bitcoin uses SHA256; it's slow and less safe) 

This is the plan of my coin. Now i need some code baby. I will not write it from scratch. I have taken LiteCoin's code as refwerence. 

Now as per our plan we needd to make few changes in the code of the coin. The changes will be made in following parts 

Part 1 : for changes as per our plan
+ amount.h
+ validation.cpp
+ qt/bitcoinunits.cpp

The above is metadata of coin 

Data required for Genesis Block :- 
+ TimeStamp Message 
+ Rewards Coin 
+ Current TimeStamp
+ Pub Secret Key Time Stamp

The Geneis Block can be created from this link :- https://newtum.com/material/cryptocurrency/

After making the changes in the code :-  
i need to deploy it to the server , I am hostinh the server on 2 ec2 nodes 

+ I have 2 ec2 :  2 vCPUs, 25 GB sotorage, 4 GB RAM  : SPAWN UBUNTU 18.04 ONLY

There are various stages of running commands, building code
